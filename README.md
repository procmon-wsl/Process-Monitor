## Introduction

Process Monitor is an advanced real-time monitoring utility from Sysinternals designed to provide deep visibility into the inner workings of the Windows operating system. It combines the capabilities of two legacy tools, Filemon and Regmon, delivering a unified interface for tracking file system, registry, process, and thread activity as it happens. With its extensive event-level detail, Process Monitor enables IT professionals, security analysts, and power users to diagnose complex system issues, investigate suspicious behavior, and understand how applications interact with the OS at a granular level.

The tool features powerful filtering options that help users narrow down vast amounts of captured data to the most relevant events, making troubleshooting significantly more efficient. Each event includes comprehensive metadata such as timestamps, process identifiers, call stacks, and result codes, supporting precise root-cause analysis. Additionally, Process Monitor offers advanced capabilities like boot-time logging, allowing visibility into system activity occurring before Windows fully loads.

Whether you're analyzing performance bottlenecks, tracking unauthorized registry modifications, or examining system changes made by newly installed software, Process Monitor provides the detailed insights necessary for accurate diagnostics. Its combination of depth, flexibility, and real-time visibility makes it an essential tool for maintaining system reliability and security in modern Windows environments.
